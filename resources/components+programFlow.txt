the Sharp 2D120x infrared distance sensor is scanning :
	1) The sharp sensor detects a moving (according to a range).
	2) An internal timer will start.
	3) The timer keeps counting as long as there is a moving in the specified range.
	   The PmodKYPD is activated (it accepts input) as long as the timer is counting.
	   The timer will stop and be set to 0 if that moving goes out of the range which leads to deactivate the PmodHYPD.
